Programs to generate:

Read all the movies files and place into files as follows:

MOVIES_ALL
  formatted -- movie,user,rating,date
USERS_ALL
  formatted -- user,movie,rating,date
  
All dates will be converted from Gregorian to a new days metric.  This will be days since first
rating.  The first rating will be 0 for a given user.

The files can be formatted for R and C++ work.  If R they will be dataframes but must always
be in the same order and cannot include dates.  Format for R:  u<user_id>, i<item_id>, rating
