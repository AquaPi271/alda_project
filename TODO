TODOS:

Get a full flow working.

(1)  Preprocess data.
(2)  Read into R and convert to real ratings matrix.
(3)  Use sampling approach.
     (a) Splitting -- stratified sampling via pre-processed data.
                      random assignment.  <--- do ths first
     (b) k-fold cross-validation -- later approach
(4)  Generate recommender
(5)  Apply recommender
(6)  Compute RMSE.

For time based constraints build input as follows:
(1)  For each user find the earliest rating.
(2)  The time index will be assigned 0 to that rating for "0 days since first rating".
(3)  Each subsequent rating will the time since the first rating.
(4)  Idea:  Have a threshold for veteran ratings versus novice ratings.  When comparing users, factor this boost in the similarity comparison.
(5)  Idea:  Have a continuous weight applied after the match by applying more weight to user ratings that have been around for longer.
(6)  Idea:  Give a stronger weight to a user who has rated more movies.
(7)  Idea:  Use purely experienced users to train rather than give more weight as in 6.
(8)  Idea:  Get cold start users and find model for them and see if it differs.
