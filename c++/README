Programs:

Read all movie files, and write out master files:
  1)  ALL_MOVIES sorted by movie.
  2)  ALL_USERS sorted by user.

movie,user,rating,date
user,movie,rating,date

Convert dates into days since the date 1/1/2000 do have a method to compare dates.

days_since_2000.cc     -- test bench to convert date to number of days since 1/1/2000
generate_all_movies.cc -- read every movie file and store into one file called ALL_MOVIES as above


Binary format of file:

movie,user,rating,days
uint16_t,uint32_t,uint8_t,uint16_t

TODO:

3-4x over Perl for UBCF.  Wish I had more time to optimize.

For tomorrow, get knn users along with # movies each matched above certain thresholds.
Get some RMSE numbers! 

Cosine is done!
Pearson is done!

Get IBCF working
  - Cosine
  - Pearson
  
Experiment with blending of global averages to low matching counts.

Blend priority:  IBCF vs. UBCF vs. Global Averages
   -- Slope-one
   -- Average blending (possibly weighted).

Normalized vs. non-normalized.

Get k-fold working.

*** Stretch goal is to include time information.


!!!! Measurements !!!!

Record what I learn along the way!!!!!
